# 15 ‚Äì Security Model

Cosmos takes a pragmatic approach to security. It prioritizes simplicity, verifiability, and deterministic behavior over complex trust chains or opaque cryptographic systems. This document outlines the current and planned security considerations.

---

Let‚Äôs get something out of the way:
> If you‚Äôre mad there's no required TLS, no GPG, and no certificate pinning, you might be looking for the wrong package manager.

Cosmos is built for systems that are already trusted, constrained, or purpose-built. If you're bootstrapping from nothing or managing an offline system, TLS and GPG are often just extra ways for things to break.

Instead, Cosmos gives you:

- Plain files
- Predictable layouts
- Auditable integrity

Security is something you layer on *if* and *when* you need it.

## üîê Trust Model
- Trust is placed in the source of the Galaxy you sync
- Galaxies are expected to be hosted by trusted parties (e.g. your own USB, S3, HTTP mirror, or Git repo)
- There is **no central verification authority**

---

## ‚ùå No TLS Required (But Optional)
- Cosmos intentionally does **not require HTTPS** or OpenSSL
- This removes runtime SSL dependencies (libssl, cert bundles, etc.)
- Galaxies can be served from:
  - Plain HTTP (default transport)
  - USB drives
  - File paths
  - IPFS or Git (via optional transport features)
  - HTTPS (if compiled with `transport-https` feature)

> If you want encrypted transport, you can use `scp`, `rsync`, `tailscale`, or enable TLS via the Cosmos transport layer.

> If you don‚Äôt trust your Galaxy source, you have no security.

You are responsible for trusting the transport medium.

## ÔøΩ Integrity
- Future: hashes of downloaded Star tarballs can be included in `star.toml`
- Future: `cosmos verify` command will compare installed files to original tarball
- Future: `cosmos freeze` lockfiles will pin exact versions and hashes

---

## ‚ú® Nova Safety
- Nova is a restricted Lua runtime designed to provide a safe API surface for install scripts. However, Nova does not prevent host escape if malicious scripts are written. It is sandboxed in spirit, not in syscall.
- All file ops go through Cosmos' internal API (e.g. `copy`, `run`, `symlink`)
- But `run()` executes real binaries on the real system
- All paths are forced under a real root prefix passed in by Cosmos
- If your script runs `rm -rf /`, that‚Äôs on you
- `--safe` flag is an upcoming feature that disables `run()` and other unsafe operations

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Responsibility Statement
> Cosmos does not attempt to "secure" things with signatures or crypto if the system using it is already untrusted. Cosmos does not enforce privilege isolation. It does not chroot, drop privileges, or namespace-isolate builds.

This philosophy mirrors tools like Alpine and Suckless:

- Auditable, human-readable scripts
- Encourage system owners to vet their inputs
- Minimal system dependencies
- Full transparency over runtime behavior
- Let users opt into higher security layers (signed hashes, reproducible builds) without mandating them

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Future Ideas
- Optional GPG-signed `meta.toml`
- Signed `universe.lock.toml` for immutable system reproducibility
- Support for hash pinning and binary transparency (optional, not core)

Cosmos aims to be secure by design, not by bureaucracy.
